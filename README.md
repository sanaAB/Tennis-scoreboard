# Tennis-scoreboard
A web app for tracking the results of a tennis game remotely, by specifying the game and player ID.
# Big idea
We are goig to install a hardware on Tennis-score-boards which can be static or dynamic. The hardware can be an Ardoino chip which reads the changes of the QR-codes attached with numbers. or it can be a raspberryPI which reads the changes using a camera with image recognition.
